      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        OpenClimateMap is an interactive web application that visualizes global
        climate data on an interactive map. It provides access to historical
        climate observations and future climate projections based on the latest
        scientific research and climate models. The application presents complex
        climate data in an accessible, user-friendly format, making it easier to
        understand how our climate is changing across different regions of the
        world.

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of OpenClimateMap is to make high-quality climate data freely
        accessible to everyone. Whether you're a researcher, student, educator,
        policy maker, or simply curious about climate change, this tool helps
        you explore and visualize climate patterns and projections for any
        location on Earth. By providing an intuitive interface to scientific
        climate data, we aim to support informed decision-making and increase
        understanding of climate change.

      <h3>Climate Scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways)</h3>
      <p>
        Future climate projections are based on different Shared Socioeconomic
        Pathways (SSP) that represent possible future greenhouse gas emission
        trajectories. Each scenario combines assumptions about population
        growth, economic development, technological progress, and climate
        policy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>SSP1-2.6 (Low Emissions):</strong> A sustainable development
          pathway with strong climate action. Global CO₂ emissions are cut to
          net zero around 2050, limiting warming to approximately 1.5-2°C by
          2100. This scenario assumes rapid transitions to renewable energy,
          improved energy efficiency, and international cooperation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SSP2-4.5 (Moderate Emissions):</strong> A middle-of-the-road
          scenario where current trends continue with some climate action.
          Emissions remain roughly at current levels before declining
          mid-century, resulting in warming of approximately 2-3°C by 2100. This
          represents moderate progress on sustainability goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SSP3-7.0 (Medium-High Emissions):</strong> A fragmented world
          with limited climate action and regional rivalry. Emissions continue
          to rise throughout the century, leading to warming of approximately
          3-4°C by 2100. This scenario assumes slow technological development
          and limited international cooperation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SSP5-8.5 (High Emissions):</strong> A fossil-fueled
          development pathway with minimal climate policy. Emissions continue to
          rise rapidly, resulting in warming of approximately 4-5°C or more by
          2100. This scenario assumes continued reliance on fossil fuels and
          high energy consumption.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em
          >Note: The numbers (e.g., 2.6, 4.5) represent the approximate
          radiative forcing (in W/m²) expected by 2100, which is a measure of
          the Earth's energy imbalance caused by greenhouse gases.</em
